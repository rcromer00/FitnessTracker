# FitnessTracker

In this assignment we were tasked with creating a fitness tracker that allows users to create the exercise they'd like to complete as well as the duration, the app then stores the data in the dashboard so the user can track their overall progress.

# User Story
 As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

# Technologies Used
This application was built using a Mongo database to house user inputs as well as Express to connect to the different routes.
